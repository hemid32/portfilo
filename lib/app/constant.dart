const String aboutMe = ''' My actual start with programming was in 2015, by attending the "Pascal language" course at the university. Later on, I started learning "Python", yet during the learning journey I did many programming projects using many tools, and dealt with different problems of programming and databases. I also learned other languages during my university trip in the specialty of embedded systems, which are "C++", "Java", and Assembly. Also, I moved to Android application programming in 2019, and the best option for me was "Flutter", in addition to using this Framework and the Programming language " Dart " .''' ;
